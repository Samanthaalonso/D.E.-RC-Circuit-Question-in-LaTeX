6. An RC circuit consists of a voltage source, a resistor, and a capacitor (and no inductor). If $Q$ is the charge collected on the capacitor, then the circuit satisfies the equation
\[R\frac{dQ}{dt} + \frac{Q}{C} = E(t),\]
Since $I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$, this equation can be written as
\[R I + \frac{Q}{C} = E(t).\]
Suppose that the external voltage applied to this circuit is
\[E(t) = E_0 \cos(\omega t),\]
and $Q(0) = 0$.

A) Substitute the steady periodic solution [Q_{sp}(t)= A\cos(\omega t) + B\sin(\omega t)\] in the equation, and find the expressions for A and B.
The steady periodic solution may also be written in the form
\[Q_{sp}(t) = C\cos(\omega t - \beta).\]

B) Derive the expression for the amplitude $C$..
